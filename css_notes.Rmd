# Loading CSS in a HTML page

## Internal styles

You can define style rules by adding a **style** element inside the **head** element of a webpage. 

> Open `/html/example.html` and take a look at how a HTML page looks when it has absolutely no styling loaded. Now, have a go at putting this `<style>` tag in the right place, between the opening `<head>` and closing `</head>` tags. It contains a CSS declaration block that targets paragraphs.

```{HTML}
<style type="text/css">
  p {
    font-size: 1.2em;
    line-height: 1.4;
  }
</style>
```

> Did you notice that the final paragraph didn't change? That's because it has an inline style added as a *style* attribute to that paragraph. While you're viewing the rendered page, try right clicking on it and choosing 'Inspect' from the menu. Can you see the inline style? You should be able to see a panel that shows you the markup, with the CSS styles that apply to it on the right. Try unticking the element.style `font-size: 0.7em` to see what the page would look like without the inline style.

## Inline styles

The **style** attribute can be used to set CSS properties directly on HTML elements. Inline styles are loaded after all other CSS, so they take priority over all other styles. They're generally best avoided but do have their uses. To add one, just add properties to the attribute in the HTML markup, separated by semi-colons like this: `style="property: value; property: value"`.

> Try adding this inline style to the **header** element in our example page.

```{HTML}
<header style="text-align: center">
```


## External styles

It's often better to keep your stylesheet in a separate file. External stylesheets can be loaded with a webpage by adding the **link** element inside the **head** element, and setting particular attributes.

> Make a new text file and save it in `/css` with the extension `.css`. Add the style rule below to this file.

```{CSS}
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

> Then load it with the example HTML page by adding the following element, again between the opening `<head>` and closing `</head>` tags. 

```{HTML}
<link href="../css/your-styles.css" rel="stylesheet" media="all" />
```
  
The **media** attribute tells the page to use these styles all the time. You can also set this to *screen* or *print*. Having a different stylesheet for printing pages can be really useful to save paper and ink. You can add this attribute to internal `<style>` tags too.

### RMarkdown

You can also load external styles with Pandoc for you RMarkdown documents. Just include the **css** option as part of the **html_document** statement in your Pandoc header, with the path to your file: 

```{Rmd}
output:
  html_document:
    css: your-stylesheet.css
```

> Take a look at the header of `css_notes.Rmd` to see what custom styles this page uses.

# Properties

Properties are specific names for all the styles that you can control. We've already used a few like `font-size`, `font-family` and `text-align`. Properties are like parameters of functions, in that they have to be spelt correctly and they can only take particular types of information. Property names are always followed by a colon, a space, and then a value, followed by a semicolon. `property: value;` It's good practice to put every property indented on it's own line, so they are easy to read and comment out.

**There are tons of properties you can set with CSS, for a full list see [here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp)**.

> Let's try some of the options in your new stylesheet. Look up **background-colour**, **background-image**, **background-repeat**, **background-position**, and **background-size**. Now, try writing a background style for the body element (don't worry about if the text is still readable just now). 

It could look something like this:

```{CSS}
body {
  background-image: url("https://jooinn.com/images/abstract-background-1.jpg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center center;
  background-size: cover;
}
```

> Try out some different values for these properties to see what they do.

# Selectors

Selectors are what you use to target HTML elements, they define which parts of the page your properties will be applied to. We've been using them already to target things like paragraphs, headers and body elements. Selectors come *before* the curly braces that contain the declaration block. You need atleast one, but you can also have multiple, comma spearated, selectors:

```{CSS}
/* will make both h1 and h2 headings bold */
h1, h2 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
/* you can use line breaks here too */
h1,
h2 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

All the tags that are used to define HTML elements can be used as selectors. You can also select targets using **class** or **ID** names that elements have been given as well as a variety of other advanced methods. Any declaration block will affect ALL elements of the type defined by it's selector.

> Try adding a new declaration block to your stylesheet. Let's make all the text more readable by targeting the element **main**. Add the style below, then inspect the element and turn the styles on and off to see what they do.

```{CSS}
main {
  background-color: black; /* fallback */
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, .7);
  color: white;
  max-width: 700px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 1em 2em;
  border-radius: 2em;
}
```

> Did you wonder why there are two declarations for **background-color**? Not all browsers accept `rgba` values (with opacity) so adding a fallback declaration *before* it makes sure there is still a compatible style. Any declaration that follows another gets loaded last and takes priority, if it can be used.

## Classes

A **class** is a type of HTML attribute used to give elements custom names. 

```{HTML}
<p class="big"></p>
```

Classes are intended to be used many times, perhaps even across different elements. So the properties they contain should make sense relative to the name, and they should work in a range of situations. 

**Classes are used as selectors like this:**

```{CSS}
.big {
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

**Classes are the prefferred way to target elements** as they allow for changes to the HTML markup, without affecting the rendering of the page. In this example we could change the markup to `<span class="big"></span>` and our style would still be applied, because it targets the class and not the element. 

> There is a **div** element with the class **special** in the the example page already `<div class="special">`. Try writing a declaration block that will make this section stand out from the rest of the page. It could look something like this:

```{CSS}
.special {
  background-color: white;
  color: #4f4f4f;
  padding: 0 2em 2em;
}
.special h2 {
  background-color: #815AA6;
  color: white;
  padding: .5em 1em;
  border-top-right-radius: 1em;
  border-bottom-right-radius: 1em;
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  left: -2em;
}
```

Spaces between selectors are used to target nested elements. The selector `.special h2` in this example targets all **h2** elements that are *inside* elements which have the class **special**. 

You can keep going too, with as many spaces as you like for deeply nested elements, but using the shortest selectors possible is recommended for speed and readability.

> Now try changing the **div** element to a **section** element instead (this tag is more descriptive). Remember to change both the opening and closing tags. Your `.special` class style declaration will still work because we didn't target the element by it's tag.

### Combining class and element selectors

You can combine class selectors with element selectors like this too: `div.special`. The `.` that prefixes the class selector acts to concatenate the two selectors together. This targets all **div** elements with the class **special**. Targeting elements in this way removes the benefits of using class names (now you can't change divs to sections without updating the CSS too). Only use selectors like this if you absolutely have to; it can be useful when you need to override a style that already specifies the element.

You can also concatenate as many classes as you want, so you can imagine a selector that looks something like this: `.special.sale` or `.special.info`. 

> What do you think the markup for these elements would look like?

These selectors target elements that have multiple classes. By using spaces as separators in the attribute you can add as many classes to an element as you like: `class="special sale whatever blah blaaaah"`. So, the selectors `.special.sale` and `.special.info` target elements that look like this: 

```html
<section class="special sale">
  <!-- some special offer here -->
</section>
<section class="special info">
  <!-- some special information here -->
</section>
```

All the elements with class **special** will use the same set of declarations but then the extra classes **sale** and **info** differentiate them. Taking this approach helps you to write less repetitive CSS.

> Copy the whole chunk of markup between `<section class="special">` and `</section>`. Paste it just above the `<footer>` to create another special section. Give this new section another class; call it whatever you like, so your class attribute ends up looking something like: `class="special new-class"`. 

I've said call it 'whatever you like' but there are some rules to class names:

- They can't have sapces.
- They can't start with a number.
- Be consistent with any other formatting you choose to use. For example, make them always lowercase with hyphens for spaces to conform to popular standards.

> Now, try adding a new declaration that changes a style for this block by targeting the new class in your stylesheet.

## IDs

An **id** is a another type of HTML attribute used to give elements custom names. It works in a very similar way to classes. However, IDs are intended to be used only once in a page, so they are usually very specific. 

**IDs are used as selectors like this:**

```{HTML}
<body id="something-particular"></body>
```

```{CSS}
#something-particular {
  /* some very particular properties */
}
```

IDs are often used on body tags so that you can write styles that are specific to particular pages. You can combine ID selectors in all the same ways as classes. So, selectors with IDs in might start to look like: `section#important`, `#about .special h2`, or `#signup.special` etc. IDs are also especially easy to target with javaScript and, because they're not intended to be repeated, make these scripts highly selective.

All the same naming rules for classes apply to IDs too.

> Try adding an ID to an element along with a style declaration that targets it in your stylesheet.

# Overriding styles

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
**Ordering is really important.**
</div>

We've already seen how ordering property declarations within declaration blocks can be important for setting colour fallbacks. The ordering of the entire stylesheet is important too. Whatever styles are written first, at the top of your stylesheet, will be loaded first. If another declaration block later on targets the same element with a different style, that later style will override the earlier one.

## Loading order

The order of styles loaded in different ways is important too. Remember how we couldn't override the inline paragraph style with our internal style? 

If you load multiple external styles, the last one loaded will override all the others. Internal styles can be loaded before or after external styles, depending on where the `<link>` and `<style>` tags are placed. Inline styles, however, are ALWAYS loaded last, so override them all.

1. **External and Internal styles** (from top to bottom).
2. **Inline styles** (from top to bottom and left to right).

> Try loading the readymade example stylesheet `/css/example.css` in the example webpage. Everything we've done together, plus a few extra styles is in this sheet. Play with the order, putting it before and after your stylesheet. Inspect elements to see what happens and get a feel for which styles override each other.

```{HTML}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/example.css" />
```

> How has the font-size declaration for the footer in my example stylesheet taken priority over the inline style we looked at earlier?

# Bootstrap

Twitter's [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is an extremeley popular grid framework which provides hundreds of styles and complimentary javascript libraries to web developers. Around 18% of all websites make use of it to underpin their layouts and custom styles ([Burge 2018](https://www.ostraining.com/blog/webdesign/bootstrap-popular/)).

**This is also the grid framework that Knitr and Shiny use in their generated HTML pages.** So, by getting familiar with Bootstrap's built in styles you can save youself time and effort when customising styles of knitted HTML documents, or Shiny apps; apply tons of pre-exisiting styles, just by adding the right class names to HTML elements. 

- Imagine you have a list
- But you want to highlight one point <span class="label label-default">this one!</span>
- So it stands out from the rest.

These labels have classes which are already defined by Bootstrap, along with other colours too: 

<span class="label label-default">Default</span> <span class="label label-primary">Primary</span> <span class="label label-warning">Warning</span> <span class="label label-danger">Danger</span> <span class="label label-success">Success</span>

```{HTML}
<span class="label label-default">Default</span>
<span class="label label-primary">Primary</span>
<span class="label label-warning">Warning</span>
<span class="label label-danger">Danger</span>
<span class="label label-success">Success</span>
```


<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-8">
This is just one small example. Bootstrap has LOADS of components and styles you can make use of, like this info alert box, link buttons, icons, menu navigation, tabbed content, and best of all, the grid framework for positioning things. The grid is customisable across different devices as all the classes have a size component like `sm`, `md` or `lg`. So on a small screen this alert is full width, but on a big screen it's split into two columns, and I didn't have to code any of the CSS that controls that myself. 
</div>
<div class="col-lg-4">
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Go See! <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></span></a>
</div>
</div>
</div>

> Watch out for the Bootstrap version being used. None of the R stuff I've looked at uses the latest releases so the best Bootstrap features are often missing. Most use v3.3 last time I checked, so I've linked to those docs above.

# Advanced Topics

> Topics for another day if any of you get really involved.

## Complex selectors

There are more complex ways to target elements. You can target every other row of a table, for example, or just the 4th element of every list. You can even use selectors to only target links that open in new tabs. Or, to specify a style that only effects the 2nd level of 3 nested lists. You can also target *states* like `:hover` and `:focus` which are used all the time for link and button styles.

## Animation and Transformations

CSS can even be used to animate, rotate and skew elements. Fading colour changes on hover is a common use example of this, but you can also do far more complex animations. 

## Browser compatability

For some properties (usually more advanced CSS3 ones) you'll have to set a range of slightly different properties in your declaration block to get them to work consistently in different browsers. Something like this:

```{CSS}
box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px black; /* Standard CSS */
-webkit-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px black; /* Chrome and Safari */
-moz-box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px 0px black; /* Firefox */
```

Sometimes styles, especially layout ones, have unexpected outcomes in different browsers too (usually Internet Explorer). There are ways to set conditional styles so that different browsers load different CSS.

## Compilers

If you ever have to write a lot of CSS, consider learning how to write [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) or [less](http://lesscss.org/). These languages have a syntax almost identical to CSS, but with additional shorthand, nesting,  and global variables. Command line compilers check your code for errors and turn it into CSS, ensuring consistent syntax and allowing you to easily change variables like colours, that might be repeated hundreds of times. Some packages can even add all the browser specific CSS properties for you automatically. Additionally, they can minify the stylesheet that is loaded on your website for increased speed, while keeping your development code easily readable. Your development code can even be split up into numerous files, and you can define which files become part of the compiled CSS.
