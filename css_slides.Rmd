# What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

- CSS is a language that describes the *style* of a HTML document. 
- It describes how particular HTML **elements** should be displayed. 

You'll need to know some basic HTML in order to understand how to use CSS.

# What is HTML?

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. It describes their *structure*. 

- A web page is made up of HTML **elements** which are represented by **tags**. 
- These tags define the type of content held within them and give HTML pages a structured hierarchy. 
- Tags  can be nested within each other, and often have **attributes** which provide additional information about the element.

# Basic HTML

All HTML pages **must have** these elements:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A title</title>
    <!-- settings and meta tags go here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

# HTML Tags

Most element tags wrap content to define where it starts and ends, so they have an opening tag like `<p>` and a closing tag like `</p>`. 

These tags all wrap:

```html
<h1>A heading</h1>
<p>A paragraph</p>
<a href="https://google.com">A link</a>
```
The link tag `<a>` needs the **href** attribute to work.

# HTML Tags

Some tags don't wrap, these have closing slashes instead:

```html
<br /> <!-- a line break -->
<hr /> <!-- a horizontal rule -->
<img src="https://tinyurl.com/y63hts5h" />
```
The image tag `<img>` needs the **src** attribute to work.

You can put tags directly in RMarkdown documents, so they can be handy to know.

# How CSS and HTML work together

Structure and style are kept separate by using CSS to declare the visual properties which are applied to HTML elements.

- CSS **selectors** target HTML **elements** and apply styles to them. 
- The styles which are applied are defined by CSS **properties**.
- A set of properties attached to a selector is a **declaration block**. 

# An example CSS declaration block

A declaration block that targets paragraphs might look something like this:

```css
p {
  font-size: 1em;
  line-height: 1;
}
```

The selector `p` is followed by curly braces that contain the declarations. Each declaration states a property to change and a value to change to: `property: value;`

In this case *all paragraphs* will have a font size of 1em and line-height (this is line spacing) of 1.

# HTML without CSS

Without CSS every webpage looks like a very boring plain text document.


# Let's make it pretty

- If you haven't already, clone this Git repository to get the example files to work with.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:StirlingCodingClub/css.git
```

- Open `html/example.html` in your web browser to see the plain example page for yourself.
- Follow the instructions in `css_notes.html` to find out how basic CSS can make this example page much more interesting.
